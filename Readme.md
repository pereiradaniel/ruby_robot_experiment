# Ruby Robot Experiment
---

## ABOUT
This is an experiment to use the Ruby language to build a small game.  The project's aim is to create a map and two objects that can move around, and launch projectiles at each other.

_File structure_
Right now the classes are divided into different files, with setup being the file that currently loads the base classes into memory.


## FILES

```
_Robot.rb_
**Robot class file**
Robots can be placed on a map.

_Map.rb_
**Map class file**
Map can have robots on it.

_Setup.rb_
**Loads Class files**

_tests.rb_
**Place commands here for testing data during development.**
```
